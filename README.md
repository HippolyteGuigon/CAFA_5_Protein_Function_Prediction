# CAFA_5_Protein_Function_Prediction
The goal of this repository is to participate to the CAFA 5 Protein Function Prediction Kaggle prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cafa-5-protein-function-prediction/overview)

## Build Status

For the moment, the project has just begun 

Throughout its construction, if you see any improvements that could be made in the code, do not hesitate to reach out at
Hippolyte.guigon@hec.edu

## Code style

The all project is coded under PEP-8 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and flake8 (https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) compliancy. Such compliance is verified during commits with pre-commits file ```.pre-commit-config.yaml```

## Installation

* To install all necessary libraries, run the following code:```pip install -r requirements.txt```
